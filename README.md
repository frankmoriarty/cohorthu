"Wallace E, Moriarty F, McGarrigle C, Smith SM, Kenny RA, Fahey T. Self-report versus electronic medical record recorded healthcare utilisation in older community-dwelling adults: comparison of two prospective cohort studies"

This study longitudinally examines patient self-reported healthcare utilisation (GP, OPD, and ED visits) and GP electronic medical record (EMR) recorded healthcare utilisation in older community-dwelling people in Ireland. It includes data from two existing cohort studies - The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) and the HRB Centre for Primary Care Research (CPCR) cohort. The former uses self-report measures of healthcare utilisation and the latter uses manual extraction of healthcare utilisation from the GP EMR.

As TILDA had broader inclusion criteria compared to the CPCR cohort, a subsample of respondents from TILDA who would have been eligible for the CPCR cohort were included in this analysis. A total of 2,307 TILDA respondents were aged â‰¥70 years at baseline, 2,070 of whom (90%) were eligible for the GMS scheme. Those with a GP visit card were not included. At least one regular medication was reported by 1,808 of these respondents (87%). Follow-up at Wave 2 was completed by 1,377 (76%) of these respondents between February 2012 and January 2013, where a further interview was conducted (see Figure 1)
